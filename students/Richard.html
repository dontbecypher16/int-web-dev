   <h1>What's up everyone!</h1>
     <p>
         My name is <b>Richard</b> and I'm looking forward to becoming a great programmer one day.
         I have been studying C#, SQL, ASP .NET Core, and Unity.
     </p>
    <p>
        These are my professional goals:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Web Developer</li>
        <li><a href="https://dronerush.com/best-drone-apps-7629/">Drone Tech</a></li>
        <li>VR Developer</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        When I'm not programming I love to indulge into my other passions as well. 
        Such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Socializing in VR social spaces</li>
        <li>Flying my drone</li>
        <li>Satisfying my nostalgia for my favorite genres from the 80s and 90s(action movies, anime and Southern rap)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I see a trajectory that VR will be the next computational frontier to explore and innovate. You might as<br />well come join the party
        now. Even if you dont have a headset you can get a glimpse of what to expect in the browser as well. If you want<br />to meet up and talk 
        and explore virtual worlds we can hang out in<a href="https://www.vrchat.com/">VRChat.</a> 
        You can look up my username which is Richvick and add me there.
