                <h2>Traveling Plans</h2>

                <p>I love to travel. One of my favorite things to do is to take cruises to beautiful islands. I find that is it relaxing to get away for a few days and enjoy time on the water. I usual try to take 2 cruises each year.Check out the link to find great cruise deals <a href="https://www.carnival.com/" target="_blank">Carnival</a></p>
